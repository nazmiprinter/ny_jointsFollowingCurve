# ny_jointsFollowingCurve
Maya script to create any number of joints/controllers on a curve

Paste the .py file to your "Users\**\Documents\maya\**\scripts" folder and run the script down below in a python tab:

import ny_jointsFollowingCurve
reload (ny_jointsFollowingCurve)

Give your setup a unique name, then enter the number of joint you want(minimum 2).
If you want controllers for each CV on the curve, select for Each CV.
If you want controls with a defined number, use the Ctrl Number button and put in a number.
If you choose neither of them or leave Ctrl Number at 0, it won't create any controllers.
